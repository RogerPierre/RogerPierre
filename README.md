## Hi there ðŸ‘‹I'm a Systems Analysis and Development (SDA) student. I have autism. I'm starting out as a programmer, but I don't have any experience in the field yet. I was born in Piaui, Brazil, in a rural town in Piracuruca.
I aspire to a secure and stable professional career.
The institution where I'm studying is called "Federal Institute of Piaui: Piripiri Campus."
